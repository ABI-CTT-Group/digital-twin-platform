    "# DigitalTWINS on FHIR - Live demo\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The examples considered in this demo involve:\n",
    "- 2 patients for Exemplar Project 1 â€“ Biomarkers for pulmonary hypertension (note that a simplified workflow with one step/tool is used here).\n",
    "- 2 patients for Exemplar Project 4 - Breast cancer reporting (6 step workflow).\n",
    "- 1 patient contributed to both projects (ie in this scenario, they have both pulmonary hypertension and breast cancer).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definitions\n",
    "- FHIR - Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources\n",
    "- FHIR Server - a server implemented according to the FHIR standard, allow users to create, update, delete, and search FHIR health data.\n",
    "- Primary Measurements - a SPARC SDS dataset.\n",
    "- CWL - Common Workflow Language.\n",
    "- Workflow tool process - generated by executing a tool/step of a workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learn how to install the digitaltwins-on-fhir python client\n",
    "- Learn how to find all primary measurements for a patient that have been contributed from multiple research studies. This includes:\n",
    "  -  finding FHIR ImagingStudy resources and their PACS endpoints.\n",
    "- Learn how to find which workflow and tool generated a specific derived measurement observation.\n",
    "- Learn how to find all tools and models used by a workflow and their workflow tool processes.\n",
    "- Learn how to find inputs and outputs of a given tool in a workflow.\n",
