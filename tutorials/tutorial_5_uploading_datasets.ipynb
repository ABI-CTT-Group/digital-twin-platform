    "- upload an SDS dataset to the 12 LABOURS DigitalTWINS platform.\n",
    "- find the dataset you uploaded on the data catalogue page of the platform's portal.\n",
    "- remove a dataset from the platfrom.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Uploading a dataset\n",
    "A data dataset (such as the one created in the previous tutorial), can be uploaded using the `digitaltwins` API's `Uploader` class as described below. Please see Tutorial 2 for more information on accessing the DigitalTWINS platform's API."

    "## Removing a dataset\n",
    "In the future, once a dataset is uploaded to the DigitalTWINS platform, a persistent DOI will be created that can be referenced in e.g. research publications. There are instances where a dataset may need to be modified (e.g. additional data is collected using the same protocol). In such cases the original version of the data cannot be removed otherwise the reference in published work will not be accessible. Instead, a new version of the dataset would need to be uploaded with its own independent and persistent DOI. This functionality along with modifications to datasets (e.g. to enable remove of subject data as described in Article 17 of the GDPR (right to be forgotten), will be implemented in future releases.\n",

    "In the meantime, the ability to delete datasets from the platform has been made temporariliy available. This can be achieved as follows."
